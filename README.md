# MOTH Productivity Suite Version 0.1

Imagine a system that helped you achieve more by doing less?
That adapted itself to fit around you, not the other way around?
A system that was about productivity and personal development.
Where rules like "No-GSB" meant, "No guilt, shame, or blame."
And, where the only way to faai, was to "fail forward."
In an era of contant distraction and the pressure to do more,
MOTH is a system that asks you to achieve more by doing less.

## Caught in the Productivity Trap
We've all been there. Associating long hours with hard work.
"Work smart, not hard," everyone said. But few people did.
My name's Dee, and I'm the Sensei at MOTH Tools. 
No a real Sensei in the Japanese sense.
Nor a Samurai in the warrior sense.
But I'm called both.
Come meet me at the shinden:
